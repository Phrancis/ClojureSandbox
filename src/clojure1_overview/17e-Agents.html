<h3><a name="Agents">Agents</a></h3>
<p>
    Agents are used to run tasks in separate threads
    that typically don't require coordination.
    They are useful for modifying the state of a single object
    which is the value of the agent.
    This value is changed by running an "action" in a separate thread.
    An action is a function that takes the current value of the Agent
    as its first argument and optionally takes additional arguments.
    <b>Only one action at a time will be run on a given Agent.</b>
</p>
<p>
    The <code>agent</code> function creates a new Agent.
    For example:
</p>
<div class="code">
<pre xml:space="preserve">
(def my-agent (agent <i>initial-value</i>))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
    The <code>send</code> function dispatches an action to an Agent
    and returns immediately instead of waiting for the action to complete.
    The action is executed in a thread from a supplied thread pool.
    When the action completes, its return value will be assigned to the Agent.
    The <code>send-off</code> function is similar,
    but uses threads from a different pool.
</p>
<p>
    The <code>send</code> function uses a "fixed thread pool"
    (see the
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newFixedThreadPool(int)">newFixedThreadPool</a>
    method in java.util.concurrent.Executors)
    where the number of threads is the number of processors plus two.
    If all of those threads are busy,
    the action doesn't run until one becomes available.
    The <code>send-off</code> function uses a "cached thread pool"
    (see the
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newCachedThreadPool()">newCachedThreadPool</a>
    method in java.util.concurrent.Executors)
    where existing threads in the pool are used if available
    and new threads are added otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    If the <code>send</code> or <code>send-off</code> functions
    are invoked from inside a transaction,
    the action isn't actually sent until the transaction commits.
    This is somewhat similar to calling
    the <code>commute</code> function on a Ref in the sense that
    the calls that determine the value to retain
    occur at the end of the transaction.
</p>
<p>
    Inside actions, the Agent on which they are operating
    is bound to the symbol <code>*agent*</code>.
</p>
<p>
    The <code>await</code> function takes any number of Agents
    and blocks the current thread until all actions
    that thread has dispatched to those Agents have completed.
    The <code>await-for</code> function is similar,
    but takes a timeout in milliseconds as its first argument.
    If the actions complete before the timeout occurs,
    it returns a non-<code>nil</code> value.
    Otherwise it returns <code>nil</code>.
    The <code>await</code> and <code>await-for</code> functions
    cannot be called inside a transaction.
</p>
<p>
    If an action throws an exception then dereferencing
    the Agent to which it was sent will also throw an exception.
    The exceptions thrown in all actions that have been sent to a given Agent
    can be retrieved by calling the <code>agent-errors</code> function.
    The <code>clear-agent-errors</code> function
    clears the collection of exceptions for a given Agent.
</p>
<p>
    The <code>shutdown-agents</code> function waits for the
    execution of all actions already sent to all Agents to complete.
    It then stops all the threads in the thread pools
    that are used by Agents.
    After this has been called, no new actions can be sent.
    Calling <code>shutdown-agents</code> is necessary to allow
    the JVM to exit in an orderly manner because
    the threads in the Agent thread pools are not daemon threads.
