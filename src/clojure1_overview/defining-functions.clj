; The `defn` macro defines a function. Its arguments are the function name, an optional documentation
; string (displayed by the `doc` macro), the parameter list (specified with a vector that can be empty) and the function body.
; The result of the last expression in the body is returned. Every function returns a value, but it may be nil.
(defn greetings
  "Returns a String greeting"
  [name]
  (str "Hello, " name))
(println "(greetings \"Clojure\") :" (greetings "Clojure")) ; Hello, World

; Function definitions must appear before their first use.
; Sometimes this isn't possible due to a set of functions that invoke each other.
; The `declare` special form takes any number of function names and creates forward declarations that resolve these cases.
; (declare function-names)

; Functions defined with the `defn-` macro are private. This means they are only visible in the namespace in which
; they are defined. Other macros that produce private definitions, such as `defmacro-`, are in clojure.core.incubator.

; Functions can take a variable number of parameters. Optional parameters must appear at the end.
; They are gathered into a list by adding an ampersand `&` and a name for the list at the end of the parameter list.

  "Calculate power using java.lang.Math static method pow"

(println "(power 2 3 4) :" (power 2 3 4))   ; 4096.0 (2^3 = 8, 8^4 = 4096)
(println "(power 2 3 4 5) :" (power 2 3 4 5)) ; 1.15292150460684698E18 (2^3 = 8, 8^4 = 4096, 4096^5 = 1.15292150460684698E18)

; Function definitions can contain more than one parameter list and corresponding body.
; Each parameter list must contain a different number of parameters. This supports overloading functions based on arity.
; Often it is useful for a body to call the same function with a different number of arguments in order to
; provide default values for some of them.

; Anonymous functions (a.k.a lambda expressions) have no name. These are often passed as arguments to a named function.
; They are handy for short function definitions that are only used in one place.
; There are two ways to define them:
(def years [1940 1944 1961 1985 1986])  ; both anonymous functions return (1940 1944 1986)
(filter (fn [year] (even? year)) years) ; long way w/ named arguments
(filter #(even? %) years)               ; short way where % refers to argument
